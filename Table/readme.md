# Student Table

This JavaScript code provides functionality to display and edit a table of student data. The table is populated with data retrieved from the browser's local storage. If no data is found in the local storage, a set of dummy data is used as a fallback.

## Features

- Displaying the table: The table is dynamically created based on the data retrieved from the local storage or the dummy data.
- Opening details in a new tab: By clicking on a row in the table, a new tab is opened, displaying additional information about the selected student's score.
- Editing table cells: The student name and score cells in the table are editable. Changes made to these cells are saved in the local storage.
- Sorting the table: Clicking on a table header sorts the table data based on the clicked column. Clicking the same header again reverses the sorting order.
